            <div id="FirstT">
                Robots are the pioneering space explorers of the future, argues Srikanth Saripalli, an assistant professor at ASU’s School of Earth and Space Explorat
                ion, in a Future Tense article for Slate magazine. 
                Responding to a space exploration roadmap recently released by NASA and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group that 
                calls for robotic and human missions to near-Earth asteroids, the Moon and Mars, Saripalli argues that most of the arguments in favor of manned
                space exploration are based on near-sighted assumptions about emerging developments in robotics.

                Saripalli posits that in the next 100 years or so, human bodies will merge with robotic technologies, leading to advancements in human durability and survivability, even in harsh environments on other planets.
                While the Curiosity rover on Mars has been successful, Saripalli points out that the robots that we have sent into space so far “are not at all ‘autonomous’ or ‘intelligent’ in any sense” and requir
                e precise instructions from Earth for every movement
                ,no matter what.

            <div id="ThirdT">
                These tiny bots will “form a self-organizing network that can quickly explore a
                reas of interest and also organize themselves into larger machines that can mine metals or develop new vehicles for future exploration.”
                Even though robotics is understood as a modern discipline, its origin goes way back – with initial protagonists being research institutes which sought solutions for hostile environments – including space. The main application on Earth are automated tasks for manufacturing or services in daily life. In the long run, robotics can push the bounda
                ries of human reach in space both for unmanned and manned exploration missions.
